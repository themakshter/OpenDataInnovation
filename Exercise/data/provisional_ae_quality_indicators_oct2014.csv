"Key
- All attendances have an unknown value for this indicator (e.g. an unknown disposal category, an unknown attendance category, an unknown duration to initial assessment / treatment / departure)
* Values suppressed to protect patient confidentiality (i.e. total number of attendances is between 1 and 5); rates corresponding to such cells have been rounded
~ High proportion of attendances have a duration to initial assessment / treatment / departure of exactly 0 minutes
  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"FOOTNOTES:
1. Sitrep data is weekly, with weeks ending on a Sunday. SitRep data for a given month is produced by aggregating weekly data for all weeks ending in that month. The number of weeks aggregated can vary from month, i.e. there may be 4 weeks ending in one month and 5 weeks ending in another. Therefore data has been scaled to adjust for this and enable a like for like comparison using the formula - scaled = (un-scaled / number of Sundays in month * 7) * number of days in month.
e.g. January 2014 had 4 Sundays:
Scaled value = (un-scaled / 4*7) * 31
2. Note that this column only presents data for those organisations which submitted data to both HES and SitReps. Therefore the England total presented here will be lower than that on the published SitReps.
3. Although data are reported to A&E HES, all attendances had an unknown attendance category",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4. The 95th percentile is particularly sensitive to poor data quality and definitional issues, which is why some unusually high values may be observed.
5. The longest wait is particularly sensitive to poor data quality and definitional issues, which is why some unusually high values may be observed. Due to the way these data have been calculated, the maximum reported wait is 23 hours and 59 minutes (1,439 minutes)
- Different indicators may use different denominators. For example, the time to initial assessment is only presented for cases brought to A&E by emergency ambulance (including air ambulance), and the time to departure for admitted patients is only presented for organisations that admit patients. For this reason some cells in the table above may be left intentionally blank
- The time to initial assessment is only reported for attendances brought in to A&E by emergency ambulance or air ambulance
- The time to treatment indicator excludes attendances where the attendance disposal was: Left Before Treatment, Left Refusing Treatment, or unknown",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6. Where initial assessment is recorded as happening before arrival, time to initial assessment is set to zero minutes
7. There are known data issues with shortfalls of records for certain organisations.  Further data quality information is available at www.hscic.gov.uk/hes.
8. The denominator for these measures includes attendances where the time is coded as MISS (missing).
9. Re-attendance rate - please note that since this measure is presented at 3-character provider level (for NHS organisations), transfers between hospitals within a provider will be counted as a re-attendance unless they are recorded as planned attendances.
Users should consider A&E type and case mix when making comparisons between organisations in Table 1.   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
